# 🔐 Encrypted ASL Recognition System

## Overview

This project is an **Encrypted American Sign Language (ASL) Recognition System** designed to enhance secure communication for deaf and hard-of-hearing users. The system performs real-time ASL recognition using computer vision and machine learning, encrypts the captured video, and securely transfers it between the frontend and backend.

It combines principles of **cryptography**, **machine learning**, **network security**, and **web development** to simulate a secure ASL communication platform.
